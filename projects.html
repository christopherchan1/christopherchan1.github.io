                            This website is my portfolio website and it is also one of my projects.
                            It will never be complete and will continue to grow as my skills develop.
                            It is currently hosted on Github pages.

                                    As one of my first web projects I had to learn a lot.
                                One of the first things I had to learn was where to even start.
                                I had to lookup how and where to host my site. I knew I just wanted 
                                something simple first so I decided I wanted a static website. I
                                browsed around for my options and I ultimately landed on GitHub pages
                                as my static site hosting. I liked that GitHub pages offered 
                                version control so I can develop iteratively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The next thing I learned after setting up my GitHub project was
                                deciding what tools to use. I already had a basic understanding of
                                HTML and CSS so I wanted to do a little more and use some sort of 
                                front-end framework. I decided to use Bootstrap as it seemed to be
                                easy to get into and for a static website I thought it would go
                                well together. I had to learn quite a bit about the syntax of Bootstrap 4 since it
                                was the first time I was using it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    I also wanted some basic animations in my portfolio wesbite. I was
                                able to find an open source animation file called Animate.css. I had
                                to learn how to integrate their CSS file into my project as well as configure
                                settings to match personal wants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    I learned how to use GIFs to demonstrate my project and
                                future projects. I did some quick research and found out how to use
                                Giphy Capture. It is a free program that is able to record my screen
                                and save the recording as a GIF. I learned that using a GIF is similar
                                to using an image file.
                            </p>

                </div>
